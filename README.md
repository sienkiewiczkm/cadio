# cadio

Basic CAD system built from scratch in C# (university project).

It supported all features needed to design a model which was later manufactured in a real factory,
most importantly: BeÃÅzier curves, b-spline curves and surfaces, filling triangular holes with
Gregory patches, finding surface intersections, surface trimming.
